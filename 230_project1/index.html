       <h2>Overview</h2>
       <p>You are here either by requirements of the profesor of this course or by some sheer luck while browsing the internet. Either way, WELCOME. My name is Alex Pecore,
	   and you have found the home page for my game. if you hover over the menu icon and click on project, you can play it, if I have made it yet. As of right now it's in the 
	   process of still being made. If you want updates on it as well as resources that I've used, you can go to the documentation page.</p>
	   <p>In the meantime, however, please direct yourself to the proposal page, where you will find a treatment of the game, where I talk about the game and the different parts of the game.</p>
