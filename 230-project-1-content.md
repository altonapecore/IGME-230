Proposal
========

You know how you can be in a rush while in a supermarket? Now you can have all that anxiety in a game

This game will put your speed and planning to the test. Your goal is to get all your groceries as fast as you can! In this top-down 2d game, you will need to avoid spills, pass slow customers, and be a master of drifting. This game may be light-hearted, but it is not for the faint of heart. Your skill will be put to the test, as well as your nerves!

Other details
=============

Designed for PC, but mobile support may be happening in the future.

Coming out May 2019!

My goal is to make it so that each level is randomly generated, so you could technically play forever.

Plan on having the same layout for the grocery store so that you can become better at the game as time goes on.
